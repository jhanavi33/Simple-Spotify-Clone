# Simple Spotify Clone

This is my **first minor project**, a simple Spotify clone created using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

---

## Project Overview

This project replicates the look and feel of the popular music streaming platform Spotify.  
It is built purely with static frontend technologies (no JavaScript or backend), focusing on layout and design using CSS.

---

## Features

- Responsive and clean UI design
- Static playlist and player interface
- Modern layout inspired by Spotify's official web player

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, and media queries)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Explore the UI and layout.

---

## What I Learned

- Structuring HTML semantically
- CSS positioning, flexbox, and grid layouts
- Styling with pure CSS to mimic real-world apps
